			<h1>Introducing packnback</h1>
			<time>10.08.2018 09:25</time>
			<div>
				

<p>This is the beginning of a project to design a new backup tool called
packnback designed to solve some of the limitations of existing tools.</p>

<p>It makes sense to explain why I we should bother in the first place,
and what interesting features a new tool can bring to the table.</p>

<h1 id="ideal-features">Ideal features</h1>

<p>I will outline features I think are important in a backup tool, lets
compare them to existing tools and then discuss prior work
and why we might want to design a new tool.</p>

<h3 id="data-deduplication">Data deduplication</h3>

<p>Don&rsquo;t store or upload the same data twice, and share data across
backups. This is important as we can do daily snapshots
while having low bandwidth and storage requirements.</p>

<h3 id="write-only-mode">Write-only mode</h3>

<p>Once a backup is transferred from machine A to machine B
we want there to be no way machine A can delete it, instead
the administrator of machine B must authorize deletion.</p>

<p>This is extremely important in the event that machine A becomes
infected by ransomware or another such attacker. It should not
be able to compromise the integrity of its</p>

<h3 id="client-side-encryption">Client side encryption</h3>

<p>Much like an email server cannot read gpg encrypted emails as
it relays them to the desired addresses,
there is no reason a backup server needs to be able to read
any backup data being stored on it. If data is encrypted client
side before it reaches a server and decrypted client side after
retrieving data, there is no reason the server needs access to the
unencrypted data.</p>

<p>Client side encryption limits trust in the server to storing data, and enforcing
write only mode actions, but never to reading it. If
the server fails it&rsquo;s storage duty, cryptography will notify
us of corrupt data or data that has been tampered with.</p>

<h3 id="secure-decryption-keys">Secure decryption keys</h3>

<p>Once a backup has been made, it should not be able
to be decrypted using any encryption key material
stored on the uploading machine. This is for the same
reason we would like write only mode, to keep data away
from attackers in the event of a security break.</p>

<p>This implies feature implies public key cryptography where we discard a
portion of a generated encryption key per backup. The private
key of the backup owner decrypts the backup, not any keys saved
on the machine uploading backups.</p>

<h3 id="pruning">Pruning</h3>

<p>Be able to rotate and prune backups is an important feature,
deduplication of data complicates things slightly as
it requires either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting">reference counting</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)">garbage collection</a>,
which in turn requires some concurrency controls. This is a why some
tools mentioned do not support pruning of data.</p>

<h3 id="open-source">Open source</h3>

<p>We need to be able to see the source code of tools
to trust thier implementation is reliable, and to trust
the privacy guarantees it offers.</p>

<p>(There are definitely other tools, let me know and the feature sets and I will add them to the list.)</p>

<p>Currently, <em>to my knowledge</em> no current software matches my requirements&hellip; (or yours perhaps?). So my conclusion for now</p>

<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>

<p>This blog series will be about designing and implementing a replacement set of backup tools
that should tick every box, while trying to be as simple as possible.</p>
