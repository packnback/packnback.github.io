      <description>This is the beginning of a project to design a new backup tool called packnback designed to solve some of the limitations of existing tools.
It makes sense to explain why I we should bother in the first place, and what interesting features a new tool can bring to the table.
Ideal features I will outline features I think are important in a backup tool, lets compare them to existing tools and then discuss prior work and why we might want to design a new tool.</description>
