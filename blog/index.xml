      <description>Rather than spend time explaining (poorly) how public/asymmetric key cryptography works, I&amp;rsquo;ll just summarize the parts we will be using.
 A key is two parts, public and private. A message can be encrypted and addressed to the public key. An encrypted message can only be decrypted by the corresponding private key. A message can be &amp;lsquo;signed&amp;rsquo; by a private key. A message signature can be verified as authentic using the corresponding public key.</description>

      <description>This is the beginning of a project to design and implement a new backup tool called packnback.
It makes sense to explain why we should bother in the first place, and what interesting features a new tool can bring to the table.
Ideal features Let&amp;rsquo;s list features that are important in a backup tool and them to existing tools so we get a good idea of the current backup tool choices you might have as an administrator trying to bullet proof a your server environment.</description>
